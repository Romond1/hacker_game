Original prompt: Preserve Mission 1, remove simulated Himari access, add profile-driven bilingual home screens, implement Follow the Trail and File Detective, add sequential unlocking, and verify locally without deployment.

## Baseline
- Mission 1 route: Desktop / Training / Agent Files / Agent Card.txt
- Mission 1 completion: open Agent Card.txt
- Local progress: intentionally ephemeral
- Production target: PHP/MySQL, not deployed in this iteration

## Progress
- Started implementation on `feature/three-mission-progression`.
- Added Mission 1 regression coverage and a typed three-mission catalog.
- Added ordered objective prerequisites, confirmation-code matching, Follow the Trail, and File Detective definitions.
- Domain/catalog checkpoint: 12 tests passing; TypeScript check passing.
