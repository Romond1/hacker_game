Original prompt: Preserve Mission 1, remove simulated Himari access, add profile-driven bilingual home screens, implement Follow the Trail and File Detective, add sequential unlocking, and verify locally without deployment.

## Baseline
- Mission 1 route: Desktop / Training / Agent Files / Agent Card.txt
- Mission 1 completion: open Agent Card.txt
- Local progress: intentionally ephemeral
- Production target: PHP/MySQL, not deployed in this iteration

## Progress
- Started implementation on `feature/three-mission-progression`.
- Added Mission 1 regression coverage and a typed three-mission catalog.
- Added ordered objective prerequisites, confirmation-code matching, Follow the Trail, and File Detective definitions.
- Domain/catalog checkpoint: 12 tests passing; TypeScript check passing.
- Local authenticated service now keeps isolated per-user mission progress, rejects locked missions, preserves best score/time, accumulates replay points, unlocks sequentially, and reports all attempts to Teacher.
- Local API checkpoint: 6 authentication/progression tests passing; TypeScript check passing.
- Added additive MySQL migration 002 for Missions 2–3 and their rewards.
- PHP API now returns per-mission progress, rejects locked starts, and unlocks the next mission inside the completion transaction.
- Standard production display names are Himari, Mirko, Cloe, and Teacher.
- Node server contract passes. PHP is not installed in this Windows environment, so PHP syntax/runtime checks remain deferred.
